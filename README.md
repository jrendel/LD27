LD27
=============

My game for the 27th Ludum Dare 48 hour game competition!

Be warned, there's A LOT of nasty hard coding going on in here! I only had 48 hours, what can I say :) Be prepared for lots of magic numbers!

Also I have been focused solely on Objective C and the Xcode environment for 2 years, so my code formatting is a mix of what I am used to, and matching what MonoDevelop generates.

Tools:
Unity 3D + Futile framework (thanks @MattRix!)
Gimp
Texture Packer
Glyph Designer

There's a live demo of the game at http://www.jasonrendel.com/LD27/LD27Web

Theme: 10 Seconds

Time Logs
=============

Graphics: 6 hours (Fri-Sat) 2 hour (Sat)
Programming: 7 hrs (Sat)

			- 10 seconds for pattern
		- but what do workers do?
	- how else does 10 seconds factor in?

 	- trying to guide something
 	- fluid - too difficult graphic-wise
